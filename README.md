# GamingCommunity
I have build my website on Angular 2 and FirebaseDB. This website helps to allow gamers to share their gaming style and post gaming contest request

This is the university project and where we need to create a useful web application. So, I come up with an idea to create a Gaming Community to help students or gamers to post the contest in one place based on different platforms.

It's been old and I am open if anyone is available to update the dependencies.
